# Hostel-And-Mess-Management-System

Welcome to the IRIS Hostel And Mess Management System (SQL) project! This repository contains a SQL-based solution for managing the allocation of college hostels and messes. The project focuses on creating an efficient database, implementing basic and complex queries, and using advanced SQL features such as ER model, procedures, views, functions, and triggers.

## Overview

Managing hostel and mess allotments in a college environment can be challenging, and a well-structured database system can significantly improve the process. This project aims to provide a SQL-based solution to streamline the allocation procedure, making it more efficient and error-free.

## Key Features

- **Normalization:** The database is designed with normalization principles in mind, ensuring data integrity, minimizing redundancy, and optimizing the overall structure.

- **SQL Queries:** The project includes a collection of SQL queries that cover various aspects of hostel and mess management, including creating tables, retrieving data, performing simple and complex queries, and more.

- **Advanced SQL:** The project demonstrates the use of advanced SQL features such as ER modeling, procedures, views, functions, and triggers to enhance the functionality and efficiency of the system.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Explore SQL Queries:** Browse the project directory to find SQL queries categorized by their purpose (e.g., creating tables, simple queries, complex queries, etc.).

2. **Use SQL Features:** Study the use of advanced SQL features such as ER modeling, procedures, views, functions, and triggers within the project to understand their implementation.
